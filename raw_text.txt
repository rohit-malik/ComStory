I’m making the first move when it comes to texting, so I’m expecting you to make the first move when it comes to kissing.
I can’t even remember the last time we spoke. We need to change that.
Do you find it sexy when girls make the first move or should I wait for you to do it yourself?
I was going to wait another day or two to text you, but I can’t wait that long to talk to you.
I could’ve sworn I saw you at the mall today, but it turned out to be some other incredibly attractive blond.
Stop sending me mixed signals and start sending me memes.
How have you gone so long without messaging me? I’m such a delight.
I had a dream we were sexting, so I woke up and decided to turn it into a reality.
I wanted to ask you out, but I figured I’d start by sending you a text.
If we have the time to “like” each other’s Instagram pics, we have the time to text.
I haven’t seen you in forever. Have you been visiting your fellow angels up in Heaven?
Did you smile when you saw my name pop up on your phone just now?
Are you hungry, by any chance? I’m starving, but no one will agree to get Chipotle with me.
I don’t really have anything to talk about, but I still want to talk to you, so… Hi.
I can’t figure out if I should start this conversation with a compliment, a horrible pick-up line, or a simple “hello.” You choose.
I just saw the new picture you uploaded. Looking hotter than ever, I see.
I hope you haven’t forgotten that I exist, because I definitely haven’t forgotten about you.
I had a dream about you last night. I’d tell you what happened, but it’s way too inappropriate.
I’ve been dying to see Star Trek Beyond (if you need a date idea).
There’s a Mewtwo at my house. You better come catch it.
I’m still single, in case you were wondering.
Hey, sexy.
I’m watching a romcom, and the main character looks exactly like you. Except, not nearly as cute.
I have Netflix on, but no one to snuggle with. Think you can help me out?
I’m thinking about deleting Tinder, because I’ve already found the guy I want to be with.
Let’s skip the small talk and go straight to flirting.
My dog wanted you to know that he misses you.
Do you have any plans for this weekend? Because I don’t.
I just heard a song on the radio, and it describes our relationship perfectly.
Be honest. How long have you been waiting for a text from me?
If you want to make a move, today would be the perfect time to go for it.
We’re hanging out tonight, just so you know.
We should really stop texting and start seeing each other in person. Preferably naked.
You know what would be even better than a text back? An invitation to dinner.
Hey. I was just wondering how long it’s going to be before you realize I like you and admit that you like me back.
I have an extra ticket to Blink 182. Interested?
I suck at starting conversations. You want to try?
You can’t text me first, but you can update your Facebook status every five minutes? I see how it is. 😜
I’m a little drunk, a little horny, and all alone.
I just took some sexy pics, but they’re too inappropriate to post on Instagram. Want to see?
Guess which emoji I just placed next to your name in my phone?
I hope you find my willingness to text first attractive.
Hey, stranger. Stop being a stranger.
I hope you don’t mind I’m texting you while naked. Or that I’ve been imagining you naked.
I just finished a book I know you would love. You should come over to pick it up.
Miss me yet?
You never text first. I can’t tell if you hate me or if you’re playing hard to get.
You already know how I feel about you. So what are you going to do about it?
Now that I’ve officially texted you, I’m going to be obsessively staring at my phone, waiting for it to beep, so don’t keep me waiting.
Flirting with you over text is always fun, but it makes it hard for me to lean in and kiss you.
