Hey… Avantika come have a seat.

Thank You… Chetan.

So Avantika.. what kind of characters you want me to introduce in my next book.

See Chetan… I know it would be difficult for you, I want the main protogonist be more dark and edgy, you know to be like be more on evil side. I know the book is a lovestory, I way to be as in to retaliate the unjust for him. You’re understanding what I am trying to say.

Ofcourse… go on I am listening.

Yes… I was snuffing the character who vows in silent fervor to avenge the past. As the tale continues the woe of revenge is taking a high note.

Okay… it’s good, I am writing all this …you can see.

Thank you Chetan for fulfilling my wants, I see nobody to discuss my thoughts but you.

Pleasure is all mine.
